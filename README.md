## This project is still under construction.  
  
### Libraries installation  
Before you run the project, you need to install a few libraries/packages listed in **requirements.txt**  
I recommend installation to new virtual environment for this project, via pip install manager:  
```
$ pip3 --version  
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt  
```
